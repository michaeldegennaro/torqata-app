# TorqataApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.9.

This is my submission for the app torqata has asked me to build, I had a lot of fun! I created a small get request using python that returns a json dataset and an angular frontend that consumes this endpoint and renders the data in a paginated table that sorts by year and filters. There is a pie graph showing the discrepency between tv shows and movies as well
